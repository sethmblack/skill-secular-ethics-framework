# Secular Ethics Framework

A universal approach to ethical decision-making based on shared human experience rather than religious doctrine. Accessible to believers and non-believers alike.

---

## Overview

**Name:** Secular Ethics Framework
**Origin:** Developed by His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama, articulated in *Ethics for the New Millennium* (1999) and *Beyond Religion: Ethics for a Whole World* (2011)
**Purpose:** Provide ethical guidance without requiring religious belief; enable moral reasoning based on universal human values
**Application:** Any ethical decision or moral dilemma

---

## When to Use
| Trigger | Situation |
|---------|-----------|
| "What should I do?" | Facing a decision with ethical implications |
| "How do I decide what's right?" | Seeking moral guidance |
| "I'm facing an ethical dilemma" | Conflicting values or uncertain choices |
| "Is this action ethical?" | Evaluating a proposed course of action |
| "I want ethical guidance but I'm not religious" | Seeking secular moral framework |
| "How do I explain ethics to someone without shared beliefs?" | Cross-cultural or interfaith ethical discussion |

---



## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| input_data | Yes | The primary data or content to analyze |
| context | No | Additional background or constraints (default: none) |
| output_format | No | Preferred format for results (default: structured markdown) |

## The Foundation: Universal Human Experience

**Starting Point:**

All ethical systems must be grounded in something humans share. This framework builds from two universal truths:

1. **All beings want happiness** - Every sentient being, without exception, desires wellbeing and contentment
2. **All beings want to avoid suffering** - Every sentient being, without exception, wishes to be free from pain and distress

These are not beliefs to be accepted on faith. They are observable facts about the nature of sentient experience.

**Implication:**

If these are true for me, they are true for others. My wish for happiness has no more inherent validity than anyone else's. From this recognition, ethical responsibility naturally arises.

---

## The Core Principle

**The Test of Any Action:**

Does this action increase or decrease suffering?
- For myself (short and long term)
- For others directly affected
- For others indirectly affected
- For the broader community/world

**Secondary Test:**

Does this action align with inner peace or disturb it?
- Actions that violate our deeper values create inner disturbance
- Sustainable happiness requires inner peace
- Inner peace is both a means and an end

---

## The Decision Framework

### Step 1: Identify the Decision

**Clarify:**
- What exactly is the choice or dilemma?
- What are the options being considered?
- Who will be affected by this decision?
- What values seem to be in conflict?

---

### Step 2: Ground in Universal Values

**Remember:**
- Everyone involved wants happiness
- Everyone involved wishes to avoid suffering
- This includes people you disagree with or dislike
- This includes yourself

**Ask:**
- What is each party's genuine interest (not just their position)?
- What suffering is each party trying to avoid?
- What happiness is each party seeking?

---

### Step 3: Analyze Consequences

**Consider Multiple Timeframes:**

| Timeframe | Questions |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Immediate** | What happens right now? Who benefits? Who suffers? |
| **Short-term** | What are the effects over days/weeks? |
| **Long-term** | What are the effects over months/years? |
| **Extended** | What patterns or precedents does this set? |

**Consider Multiple Circles:**

| Circle | Questions |
|--------|-----------|
| **Self** | How does this affect my wellbeing, inner peace, integrity? |
| **Directly involved** | How does this affect the immediate parties? |
| **Indirectly involved** | How does this affect others connected to the situation? |
| **Broader community** | How does this affect society, environment, future generations? |

---

### Step 4: Check Against Core Values

**Universal Human Values:**
These values appear across cultures and represent accumulated human wisdom:

| Value | Question |
|-------|----------|
| **Compassion** | Does this show genuine concern for others' suffering? |
| **Honesty** | Is this truthful? Does it build or undermine trust? |
| **Fairness** | Does this treat others as I would wish to be treated? |
| **Responsibility** | Am I taking ownership of my actions and their effects? |
| **Respect** | Does this honor the dignity of those involved? |
| **Restraint** | Am I acting from wisdom or from impulse? |

---

### Step 5: Examine Motivation

**Critical Question:**
What is actually motivating this action?

| Motivation Type | Examples | Assessment |
|----------------|----------|------------|
| **Self-centered negative** | Greed, revenge, fear, desire to harm | Almost always problematic |
| **Self-centered neutral** | Self-preservation, meeting needs | Consider balance with others' needs |
| **Other-centered positive** | Genuine care, wish to help | Generally beneficial |
| **Mixed** | Complex, multiple motivations | Examine the dominant driver |

**Note:** Self-care is not inherently wrong. The question is whether self-concern is balanced with concern for others.

---

### Step 6: Test Against Inner Peace

**The Inner Peace Test:**

1. Imagine having taken this action
2. Imagine reflecting on it a day later, a year later, at the end of your life
3. Does this bring inner peace or inner disturbance?
4. Can you do this with a clear conscience?
5. Would you be comfortable if this action were known to those you respect?

**Interpretation:**
- Inner peace suggests alignment with deeper values
- Inner disturbance suggests violation of those values
- This is not about social approval but about integrity

---

### Step 7: Make the Decision

**Synthesis:**

Based on the analysis:
1. Which option best reduces overall suffering?
2. Which option best increases genuine wellbeing?
3. Which option aligns with universal values?
4. Which option preserves inner peace?

**Acknowledge Uncertainty:**
- Perfect certainty is rarely possible
- We act with the best understanding available
- We remain open to learning and adjusting

---

### Step 8: Commit to Responsibility

**After deciding:**
- Own the decision as yours
- Accept responsibility for consequences
- Stay open to feedback and adjustment
- Learn from outcomes for future decisions

---

## Handling Common Ethical Challenges

### When Values Conflict

**Approach:**
1. Identify both values clearly
2. Determine which serves deeper human welfare
3. Look for creative solutions honoring both
4. If forced to choose, minimize overall suffering

**Example:** Truth vs. Kindness
- Generally, truth serves welfare (builds trust, enables good decisions)
- Sometimes, untempered truth causes unnecessary harm
- Seek truthfulness delivered with compassion
- Rare exceptions: when truth serves only cruelty

---

### When Self-Interest and Others' Interest Conflict

**Principle:**
- Your interests have validity (you too want happiness and freedom from suffering)
- Others' interests have equal validity
- Seek win-win solutions where possible
- When impossible, consider: who suffers more from each option?

**Caution:**
- Pure self-sacrifice often isn't sustainable or helpful
- Pure self-interest harms others and ultimately yourself
- Balance is the goal

---

### When Facing Systemic Injustice

**Considerations:**
- Individual ethics exist within larger systems
- Sometimes personal ethics require confronting unjust systems
- Nonviolent resistance can be ethically required
- Complicity with injustice is also a choice with consequences

---

## The Relationship to Religious Ethics

**This framework:**
- Does not require religious belief
- Does not contradict religious ethics (for most traditions)
- Provides common ground for ethical dialogue
- Allows religious people to engage their tradition while communicating universally

**Compatibility:**
Most religious ethical traditions also value compassion, honesty, fairness, and responsibility. This framework articulates a common foundation that religious and secular people can share.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather and Review Inputs

Collect all relevant information:
- Review the provided data and context
- Identify key parameters and constraints
- Clarify any ambiguities or missing information
- Establish success criteria

### Step 2: Analyze the Situation

Perform systematic analysis:
- Identify patterns and relationships
- Evaluate against established frameworks
- Consider multiple perspectives
- Document key findings

### Step 3: Generate Recommendations

Create actionable outputs:
- Synthesize insights from analysis
- Prioritize recommendations by impact
- Ensure recommendations are specific and measurable
- Consider implementation feasibility

## Output Format

When helping someone apply this framework:

1. **Clarify the dilemma** - What exactly is the choice?
2. **Identify all parties** - Who is affected?
3. **Ground in universals** - Everyone wants happiness, no one wants suffering
4. **Analyze consequences** - Short-term, long-term, all circles
5. **Check values** - Compassion, honesty, fairness, responsibility
6. **Examine motivation** - What's really driving the options?
7. **Test inner peace** - Which choice can be lived with?
8. **Support decision** - Help them commit and take responsibility

## Sample Application

**Dilemma:** "My friend's business is failing and they've asked me to write a fake positive review. I want to help but it feels wrong."

**Analysis:**

1. **Universal Ground:** Your friend wants happiness (business success, financial security). Potential customers want happiness (good products/services, not being deceived).

2. **Consequences:**
   - Short-term: Friend feels supported, customers may be misled
   - Long-term: Friend's business may fail anyway if underlying problems persist; your integrity is compromised; customers lose trust when they discover the truth

3. **Values Check:**
   - Compassion: You want to help (good), but misleading customers harms them
   - Honesty: A fake review is by definition dishonest
   - Fairness: Customers deserve accurate information

4. **Motivation:** Friendship, loyalty (positive) + desire to avoid difficult conversation (less positive)

5. **Inner Peace Test:** Could you live with this if customers were harmed?

6. **Alternative:** Could you help your friend in honest ways? Offer genuine feedback to improve the business? Write a truthful review highlighting genuine strengths?

**Conclusion:** Declining the fake review while offering genuine support serves everyone's deeper welfare, including your friend's.
